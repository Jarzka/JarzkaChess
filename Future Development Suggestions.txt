- Linear searching is used a lot in this project. Changing some data structures might make the program faster.
- Constructors invoking overridable methods need to be eliminated.
- Some small classes must be changed to immutable.
- Using Java 8's new features like lambda expressions, forEach and streams might make the code more flexible and easier to read.
- Implementation of special moves.
- Faster and smarter AI. :)
