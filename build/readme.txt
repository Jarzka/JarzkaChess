You can start the game by double clicking the .jar file on Windows.

However, the AI seems to work much faster if the app is run from the command line for some reason.

To open command line on windows, navigate to the project's build foder and right click
and empty area in File explorer while holding Ctrl and Shift at the same time.
Click "Open command prompt here" and type:
java -jar "JarzkaChess Preview 2.jar"
